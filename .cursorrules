# Project Intelligence

## Project Patterns
- Private data security is a top priority in all implementation decisions
- Backend must proxy all AITable.ai API requests to protect API keys and credentials
- Backend must also proxy all ClickUp API requests to protect API tokens and credentials
- Financial data requires special handling and validation
- Component-based architecture should be followed for maintainability
- Responsive design is required for all UI elements
- Next.js API routes are used for secure backend functionality
- AITable relation fields (Client, Mediabuyer) may be strings or arrays and need special handling
- Projects are grouped by team and sorted by start date
- Projects are filtered to show only "Launched" and "Onboarding" stages
- Leadgen metrics components share patterns but have customizations for specific data structures

## User Preferences
- Clear, intuitive data visualization is preferred over complex displays
- Quick access to financial metrics is a primary user goal
- Security with minimal friction in the user experience
- Export functionality for reports is important
- Filter and date range selection for all data views
- Project information should be easily accessible on the home page
- Team-based organization of projects for better visual grouping
- Color-coded status indicators for different project stages
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Consistent visualization formats between similar data types

## Known Challenges
- AITable.ai API may have rate limits that need to be managed
- ClickUp API has rate limits (100 requests per minute per token) that must be respected
- Private financial data requires secure handling throughout the application
- Different user roles need different levels of data access
- Performance optimization for potentially large datasets
- Balancing real-time data with system performance
- Handling relationships between different AITable tables (projects, clients, members)
- Resolving relation fields like Client and Mediabuyer that may be strings or arrays
- Calculating and displaying months active based on start date
- Integrating ClickUp task data with project management workflow
- Date parsing from Title fields in leadgen components needs optimization

## Implementation Notes
- Authentication must be implemented at both frontend and backend
- API requests to AITable.ai should be cached when appropriate
- API requests to ClickUp should be cached when appropriate
- Error handling should be robust and user-friendly with specific status codes
- Testing should cover security scenarios extensively
- Code organization should follow clear separation of concerns
- Environment variables should be used for all sensitive configuration
- SWR is planned for data fetching and caching
- Record ID detection should use regex like /^rec[a-zA-Z0-9]{8,}$/
- Team-based grouping uses the team_lookup field from AITable
- Shared component patterns between leadgen metrics components
- Date range selection component used across multiple data visualization components

## API Integration Rules
- AITable API: See aitable-rules.mdc for detailed usage guidelines
- ClickUp API: See clickup-rules.mdc for detailed usage guidelines and examples
- Rate limit handling for ClickUp API is critical (100 requests per minute)
- Both AITable and ClickUp credentials must be protected via backend proxying

## Evolution of Decisions
- Starting with focus on active projects display on home page
- Will expand to financial reporting panels in next phase
- May need to refine data refresh strategies based on usage patterns
- UI/UX decisions will evolve based on user feedback
- Using Next.js with API routes instead of separate frontend/backend
- Using Firebase for authentication with development bypass option
- Implementing relation field resolution on the backend for better performance
- Moving from individual component state to more centralized data management
- Added ClickUp integration for task management capabilities
- Created shared patterns between leadgen metrics components for consistency
