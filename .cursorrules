# Project Intelligence

## Project Patterns
- Private data security is a top priority in all implementation decisions
- Backend must proxy all AITable.ai API requests to protect API keys and credentials
- Financial data requires special handling and validation
- Component-based architecture should be followed for maintainability
- Responsive design is required for all UI elements
- Next.js API routes are used for secure backend functionality

## User Preferences
- Clear, intuitive data visualization is preferred over complex displays
- Quick access to financial metrics is a primary user goal
- Security with minimal friction in the user experience
- Export functionality for reports is important
- Filter and date range selection for all data views
- Project information should be easily accessible on the home page

## Known Challenges
- AITable.ai API may have rate limits that need to be managed
- Private financial data requires secure handling throughout the application
- Different user roles need different levels of data access
- Performance optimization for potentially large datasets
- Balancing real-time data with system performance
- Handling relationships between different AITable tables (projects, clients, members)

## Implementation Notes
- Authentication must be implemented at both frontend and backend
- API requests to AITable.ai should be cached when appropriate
- Error handling should be robust and user-friendly
- Testing should cover security scenarios extensively
- Code organization should follow clear separation of concerns
- Environment variables should be used for all sensitive configuration
- SWR is used for data fetching and caching

## Evolution of Decisions
- Starting with focus on active projects display on home page
- Will expand to financial reporting panels in next phase
- May need to refine data refresh strategies based on usage patterns
- UI/UX decisions will evolve based on user feedback
- Using Next.js with API routes instead of separate frontend/backend
- Using Firebase for authentication with development bypass option
