## Current Status
The project is in the active implementation phase with multiple parallel development streams. We have established the core architecture and implemented the main dashboard for Texonica.com displaying active projects. The backend API infrastructure is in place with secure integrations to AITable.ai, ClickUp, Google Gemini API, and Chargebee, all properly configured with comprehensive error handling.

The ActiveProjects component has been enhanced with team-based grouping, sorting by start date, and proper client/media buyer resolution. Project management capabilities have been implemented through the StageDropdown and CRMStageDropdown components. Data visualization is handled through UWLeadgenMetricsChart and FVRLeadgenMetricsChart components with flexible display options, interactive filtering, and optimized performance.

We've implemented direct interaction with AITable records through DatePickerInput, URLInput, and AITableViewButton components. ClickUp API integration enables task management capabilities with proper rate limit handling. Google Gemini API integration provides AI capabilities for planned features like transaction categorization and insights generation. Chargebee integration provides subscription management capabilities with webhook handling for subscription lifecycle events.

We've designed a comprehensive rate limiting strategy to optimize API usage across all external services. We've also implemented a telemetry system for API usage tracking and LLM cost monitoring. We're now working on financial tracking features with API endpoints for payments and subscriptions, CSV import functionality for Xolo financial data, and AI-powered transaction categorization using the Gemini API.

Recent logs show active development and usage of the leadgen API routes, particularly for the crm/future and uw endpoints, with successful telemetry tracking of API requests. The authentication bypass for development mode is working as expected, facilitating testing of these endpoints.

## Features in Development

### CSV Payment Import & Reconciliation System
**Status**: Planned

We've created a comprehensive plan to enhance the CSV import functionality for financial data. This system will:

1. Track payment directions (incoming/outgoing) and sources (Stripe, Wire, PayPal)
2. Preserve original sender information while mapping to AITable clients
3. Implement source-specific processing logic for each payment type
4. Provide intelligent client matching with confidence indicators
5. Create a persistent mapping system for sender-to-client relationships
6. Enhance the reconciliation dashboard with source-specific analytics

The plan is organized into four phases:
- Phase 1: Core CSV Import Foundation (schema updates, parser enhancements, client mapping)
- Phase 2: Source-Specific Processing (Stripe/Chargebee, Wire Transfer, PayPal handlers)
- Phase 3: User Interface & Reconciliation (UI improvements, dashboard enhancements)
- Phase 4: Data Quality & Automation (mapping system, reporting & analytics)

Next steps include implementing the schema updates and parser enhancements in Phase 1.
