# Progress

## Completed Work
- Initialized project documentation and Memory Bank
- Defined high-level requirements and project scope
- Established basic architectural approach
- Set up environment variables for AITable API integration (Projects, Clients, Members, UW LeadGen)
- Implemented secure backend API routes for projects and clients with:
  - Proper error handling with specific status codes
  - Client name resolution from client IDs
  - Media buyer information retrieval from members table
- Created ActiveProjects component with:
  - Project data display in tabular format
  - Team-based grouping
  - Sorting by start date
  - Status indicators with color coding
  - Client and media buyer name resolution
- Implemented DashboardContent component for the main dashboard layout
- Created custom AITable API client with comprehensive error handling
- Added project status visualization on the dashboard home page

## Current Status
The project is in the active implementation phase. We have established the core architecture and implemented the main dashboard for Texonica.com displaying active projects. The backend API for secure AITable.ai integration has been set up with proper configuration for all required tables. We have implemented detailed API routes for projects with robust error handling, client name resolution, and media buyer integration. The ActiveProjects component has been created and connected to the backend API, allowing users to view projects grouped by team and sorted by start date. We are now working on enhancing the project information display with calculated fields like months active, implementing authentication, and preparing for the financial reporting panels implementation.

## What Works
- Documentation structure established
- High-level architecture defined
- Key requirements identified
- Integration strategy outlined
- Environment configuration for AITable API (all tables)
- Secure backend API routes for accessing AITable.ai
- Project and client data retrieval from AITable
- Team-based grouping of projects
- Sorting projects by start date
- Error handling for API failures with descriptive messages
- Dashboard content layout
- Active projects component with proper data display
- Client name resolution from client IDs
- Media buyer resolution from member IDs
- Stage visualization with color coding

## What's Left
- Add months active calculation based on start date
- Implement additional sorting and filtering options
- Set up Firebase authentication
- Implement role-based access control
- Develop financial reporting panels
- Create specialized data visualizations
- Optimize data fetching with SWR caching
- Implement testing infrastructure
- Add UW LeadGen components and dashboard views
- Create detailed client views
- Implement export functionality
- Add custom reporting features
- Set up deployment pipeline

## Known Issues
- Need to implement proper caching to prevent API rate limiting
- Some AITable relation fields need better handling
- Authentication with role-based access not yet implemented
- Months active calculation needs to be added
- Advanced filtering not yet implemented
- Need a strategy for handling real-time data updates
