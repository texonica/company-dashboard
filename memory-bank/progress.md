## Current Status
The project is in the active implementation phase. We have established the core architecture and implemented the main dashboard for Texonica.com displaying active projects. The backend API for secure AITable.ai integration has been set up with proper configuration for all required tables. We have implemented detailed API routes for projects with robust error handling, client name resolution, and media buyer integration. 

The ActiveProjects component has been enhanced and connected to the backend API, allowing users to view projects grouped by team and sorted by start date. We've also implemented CRMStageDropdown and StageDropdown components for improved project management. We've created visualization components including UWLeadgenMetricsChart and FVRLeadgenMetricsChart for lead generation metrics with flexible display options and interactive filtering.

We've integrated ClickUp API functionality to enable task management capabilities with proper API client implementation, type definitions, and backend proxying with rate limit handling. We've started implementing financial tracking features with new API endpoints for payments and subscriptions. We've added components for interacting with AITable records, including DatePickerInput for date selection, URLInput for URL field editing, and AITableViewButton for direct record access.

We're now working on enhancing the project information display with calculated fields like months active, implementing the financial reporting panels, and developing the CSV import functionality for Xolo financial data. We're also planning to implement authentication with Firebase, role-based access control, and improved data fetching strategies.
