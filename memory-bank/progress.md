# Progress

## Completed Work
- Initialized project documentation and Memory Bank
- Defined high-level requirements and project scope
- Established basic architectural approach
- Identified key integration points with AITable.ai
- Defined home page requirements for active projects display
- Set up environment variables for AITable API integration (Projects, Clients, Members, UW LeadGen)
- Implemented backend API routes for projects and clients
- Created ActiveProjects and DashboardContent components
- Configured secure AITable API token handling
- Implemented comprehensive error handling in API routes
- Added test route for AITable connection verification

## Current Status
The project is in the initial implementation phase. We have established the core architecture and begun implementing the dashboard for Texonica.com. The backend API for secure AITable.ai integration has been set up with proper configuration for all required tables. We have implemented API routes for projects and clients with robust error handling, and created frontend components for displaying the data. The ActiveProjects component has been implemented and is connected to the backend API. We now need to complete the active projects display with all required fields and implement the financial reporting panels.

## What Works
- Documentation structure established
- High-level architecture defined
- Key requirements identified
- Integration strategy outlined
- Home page requirements specified
- Environment configuration for AITable API (all tables)
- Project and client data retrieval from AITable
- Error handling for API failures
- Dashboard content layout
- Active projects component structure connected to backend

## What's Left
- Complete home page implementation with all required project fields
- Enhance backend API for retrieving team members information
- Implement data transformation for calculating months active and other metrics
- Implement sorting and filtering functionality
- Set up Firebase authentication
- Implement role-based access control
- Develop financial reporting panels
- Create visualizations for key metrics
- Improve loading states and user feedback
- Optimize data fetching and caching
- Implement testing
- Set up deployment pipeline
- Create UW LeadGen components and dashboard views

## Known Issues
- Need to optimize AITable.ai API calls to prevent rate limiting
- Security considerations for handling private financial data
- Potential performance concerns with large datasets
- Complexity of financial reporting requirements
- Need for efficient data refresh mechanisms
- Handling relationships between team members and projects efficiently
