## Current Status
The project is in the active implementation phase with multiple parallel development streams. We have established the core architecture and implemented the main dashboard for Texonica.com displaying active projects. The backend API infrastructure is in place with secure integrations to AITable.ai, ClickUp, and Google Gemini API, all properly configured with comprehensive error handling.

The ActiveProjects component has been enhanced with team-based grouping, sorting by start date, and proper client/media buyer resolution. Project management capabilities have been implemented through the StageDropdown and CRMStageDropdown components. Data visualization is handled through UWLeadgenMetricsChart and FVRLeadgenMetricsChart components with flexible display options, interactive filtering, and optimized performance.

We've implemented direct interaction with AITable records through DatePickerInput, URLInput, and AITableViewButton components. ClickUp API integration enables task management capabilities with proper rate limit handling. Google Gemini API integration provides AI capabilities for planned features like transaction categorization and insights generation.

We've designed a comprehensive rate limiting strategy to optimize API usage across all external services. We're now working on financial tracking features with API endpoints for payments and subscriptions, CSV import functionality for Xolo financial data, and AI-powered transaction categorization using the Gemini API.
