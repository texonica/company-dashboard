# Progress

## Completed Work
- Initialized project documentation and Memory Bank
- Defined high-level requirements and project scope
- Established basic architectural approach
- Identified key integration points with AITable.ai
- Defined home page requirements for active projects display
- Set up environment variables for AITable API integration (Projects, Clients, Members)
- Implemented basic backend API routes for projects and clients
- Created ActiveProjects and DashboardContent components
- Configured secure AITable API token handling

## Current Status
The project is in the initial implementation phase. We have established the core architecture and begun implementing the dashboard for Texonica.com. The backend API for secure AITable.ai integration has been set up with proper configuration. We have implemented initial API routes for projects and clients, and created frontend components for displaying the data. We now need to complete the active projects display with all required fields and implement the financial reporting panels.

## What Works
- Documentation structure established
- High-level architecture defined
- Key requirements identified
- Integration strategy outlined
- Home page requirements specified
- Environment configuration for AITable API
- Basic project and client data retrieval from AITable
- Dashboard content layout
- Active projects component structure

## What's Left
- Complete home page implementation with all required project fields
- Enhance backend API for retrieving team members information
- Implement data transformation for calculating months active and other metrics
- Implement sorting and filtering functionality
- Set up Firebase authentication
- Implement role-based access control
- Develop financial reporting panels
- Create visualizations for key metrics
- Improve error handling and loading states
- Optimize data fetching and caching
- Implement testing
- Set up deployment pipeline

## Known Issues
- Need to optimize AITable.ai API calls to prevent rate limiting
- Security considerations for handling private financial data
- Potential performance concerns with large datasets
- Complexity of financial reporting requirements
- Need for efficient data refresh mechanisms
- Handling relationships between team members and projects efficiently
