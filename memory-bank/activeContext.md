# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are currently in the initial planning phase of the Texonica.com dashboard project. The main focus is defining the project requirements, architecture, and roadmap. We are establishing how to securely connect to the AITable.ai API and determining the primary panels needed for financial reporting.

## Recent Changes
- Initialized Memory Bank documentation structure
- Defined high-level project goals and requirements
- Established the need for secure AITable.ai integration
- Identified financial reporting as a key component
- Created detailed roadmap.md file for tracking progress and implementation discussions

## Next Steps
- Explore AITable.ai API capabilities and limitations
- Define specific data models needed for the dashboard
- Create technical specifications for the backend API
- Design initial wireframes for key dashboard panels
- Establish authentication requirements and approach
- Finalize technology stack decisions
- Create development roadmap with milestones

*For detailed roadmap and implementation discussions, see [roadmap.md](roadmap.md)*

## Active Decisions
We need to determine the best approach for:
- Frontend framework and UI component library selection
- Backend architecture and API design
- Authentication mechanism (JWT, OAuth, etc.)
- Deployment strategy and hosting environment
- Testing strategy and quality assurance processes
- Specific panels and reports to include in initial release

## Open Questions
- What specific AITable.ai bases will we need to access?
- What are the performance characteristics of the AITable.ai API?
- What are the specific financial metrics that need to be displayed?
- What level of user role granularity is required?
- What are the data refresh requirements (real-time vs. periodic)?
- Are there any regulatory compliance requirements to consider?
- What are the expected user volumes and usage patterns?
