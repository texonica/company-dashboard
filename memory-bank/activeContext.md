# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are implementing financial tracking features, enhancing the project management interface, and integrating external API services for the Texonica.com dashboard. We have established secure connections to AITable.ai API, ClickUp API, and Google Gemini API through backend routes to retrieve and manage project, client, leadgen, and task data. All the backend API routes have been implemented with comprehensive error handling.

We have several key components for improved data entry and interaction:
- DatePickerInput component for date field editing with calendar interface
- URLInput component for URL field editing with validation
- AITableViewButton component for direct AITable record access
- StageDropdown and CRMStageDropdown components for project status management
- UWLeadgenMetricsChart and FVRLeadgenMetricsChart for interactive lead generation metrics

Our current focus areas include:
1. Financial tracking features with API endpoints for payments and subscriptions
2. PnL tracking system with CSV import for Xolo financial data
3. AI capabilities using Google Gemini API integration
4. Optimizing API usage with comprehensive rate limiting strategy
5. Enhancing data visualization with customizable chart components

## Recent Changes
- Integrated Google Gemini API with secure backend proxying
- Implemented comprehensive rate limiting strategy design for all external APIs
- Enhanced DatePickerInput component with improved loading state feedback
- Optimized URLInput component for better user experience with validation
- Added AITableViewButton component for direct AITable record access
- Enhanced CRMStageDropdown component for improved project management
- Updated StageDropdown component with better loading state feedback
- Improved ActiveProjects component with better error handling and performance
- Optimized leadgen metrics charts for better performance with large datasets
- Enhanced chart rendering capabilities for different data visualization needs
- Implemented backend proxy API routes for all external services (AITable, ClickUp, Gemini)
- Started implementation of payments and subscriptions API endpoints
- Designed financial data import workflow for Xolo CSV data
- Planned transaction categorization system with AI/ML capabilities
- Created structure for many-to-many payment-project relationship modeling

## Next Steps
- Complete the payments and subscriptions API endpoints
- Implement CSV import functionality for Xolo financial data
- Create financial reporting panels with:
  - Gross margin calculation at project, team, and company levels
  - Project count visualization per team
  - PnL reporting with multi-level analysis
- Develop AI-powered features using Gemini API:
  - Transaction categorization
  - Project summary generation
  - Financial insights and recommendations
- Implement the complete rate limiting strategy with:
  - Request throttling/queuing
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Batch request processing
  - Comprehensive caching
  - Request prioritization
- Enhance the active projects display with:
  - Months active calculation based on start date
  - Additional filtering options
  - Improved sorting capabilities
- Implement authentication with Firebase
- Set up role-based access control
- Optimize data fetching with SWR caching
- Add additional data visualizations for key metrics
- Implement testing infrastructure
- Create detailed client views
- Implement export functionality for reports and visualizations
- Integrate ClickUp tasks with project management views

## Active Decisions
We need to determine the best approach for:
- CSV import and parsing strategy for Xolo financial data
- Data model for many-to-many payment-project relationships
- AI integration strategy using Gemini API for various features
- Subscription tracking model and integration with Chargebee
- Financial reconciliation workflow UI and logic
- Implementation of the comprehensive rate limiting strategy
- Caching strategy optimization using SWR
- User interface design for financial reporting panels
- Dashboard layout customization for different user roles
- Authentication implementation with Firebase
- Data refresh strategy (manual vs. automatic)
- Calculation and display of project duration (months active)
- Integration of ClickUp tasks with project management workflow
- Performance optimization for chart components with large datasets
- Testing strategy for ensuring reliability and security
