# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are implementing financial tracking features, enhancing the project management interface, and integrating external API services for the Texonica.com dashboard. We have established secure connections to AITable.ai API, ClickUp API, and Google Gemini API through backend routes to retrieve and manage project, client, leadgen, and task data. All the backend API routes have been implemented with comprehensive error handling.

Recent logs indicate active development and usage of the leadgen API routes, particularly the `/api/leadgen/crm/future` and `/api/leadgen/uw` endpoints, which are retrieving data from AITable.ai. The API telemetry system is successfully tracking these requests.

We have several key components for improved data entry and interaction:
- DatePickerInput component for date field editing with calendar interface
- URLInput component for URL field editing with validation
- AITableViewButton component for direct AITable record access
- StageDropdown and CRMStageDropdown components for project status management
- UWLeadgenMetricsChart and FVRLeadgenMetricsChart for interactive lead generation metrics

Our current focus areas include:
1. Financial tracking features with API endpoints for payments and subscriptions
2. PnL tracking system with CSV import for Xolo financial data
3. AI capabilities using Google Gemini API integration
4. Implementing our comprehensive rate limiting strategy across all external APIs
5. Monitoring and observability tools for API usage tracking
6. Developing payment processing logic for handling different payment systems
7. Enhancing data visualization with customizable chart components
8. Optimizing leadgen API performance and data handling

  - Comprehensive caching
  - Request prioritization
- Create LLM provider middleware for abstracting multiple AI services:
  - Implement Claude and OpenAI providers
  - Design unified interface for all LLM interactions
  - Build provider factory pattern for easy switching
- Set up Grafana integration for monitoring API performance, cache effectiveness, and LLM costs
- Implement server-side caching metrics for tracking hit rates and performance impacts
- Create monitoring dashboards for operations management
- Enhance the active projects display with:
  - Months active calculation based on start date
  - Additional filtering options
  - Improved sorting capabilities

- Integrate ClickUp tasks with project management views

## Active Decisions
We need to determine the best approach for:
- CSV import and parsing strategy for Xolo financial data
- Data model for many-to-many payment-project relationships
- AI integration strategy using Gemini API for various features
- LLM provider abstraction middleware design (after implementing Claude and OpenAI)
- Subscription tracking model and integration with Chargebee
- Financial reconciliation workflow UI and logic
- Implementation of the comprehensive rate limiting strategy
- Caching strategy optimization using SWR
- User interface design for financial reporting panels
- Dashboard layout customization for different user roles
- Authentication implementation with Firebase
- Data refresh strategy (manual vs. automatic)
- Calculation and display of project duration (months active)
- Integration of ClickUp tasks with project management workflow
- Performance optimization for chart components with large datasets
- Testing strategy for ensuring reliability and security
- Metrics to include in monitoring dashboards
- API usage tracking and visualization approach
- LLM cost management and optimization strategy
- Leadgen data aggregation approach for different time-based views
